# CS:GO Cheat Archive 
A collection of CS:GO cheat projects I have worked on (For archiving purposes, these projects aren't functional)

## This is part of an archive of a collection of projects I have made in 2020
- Basic Test Project "kGlow/R0G"

The projects feature usermode and/or kernel mode to perform their intended function.
You are free to use the source files in any way according to the AGPL v3.0 license. You must:
1. Provide credit when using or deriving from a line of code.
2. Ensure your project is open source (as required by AGPL)

*Disclaimer*: the project was inspired and dervied from other works such as GarHal and other publicly available repositories.
